## How We Discovered This Threat

### Initial Detection

The investigation began when a consumer noticed their keyboard was showing up incorrectly in their system:

```
lsusb
```


**Expected Result:** AULA F75 Max Gaming Keyboard  
**Actual Result:** `Bus 001 Device 007: ID 0c45:800a Microdia Vivitar Vivicam3350B`

üö® **RED FLAG:** The keyboard was masquerading as a **digital camera** - a classic sign of malicious hardware.

### System Log Analysis

We examined system logs to understand how the device was being recognized:

```
dmesg
```


**Concerning Finding:** The device showed **dual identity behavior**:
- System logs: Properly identified as "AULA F75Max" 
- USB enumeration: Falsely claimed to be a "Vivitar camera"

This inconsistency indicated sophisticated USB ID spoofing designed to evade security detection.

### Deep Technical Investigation

Using advanced USB traffic analysis tools, we captured and analyzed the device's actual behavior:

```
tshark -r /tmp/f75max_limited_capture.pcap -Y "usb.device_address == 13 and usb.data_len > 0" -T fields -e frame.number -e usb.data_len -e usb.capdata
```


**Critical Discovery:** The keyboard was transmitting abnormally large packets:
- **Normal keyboards:** 8-byte packets
- **This malicious device:** Up to 116-byte packets
- **Traffic pattern:** Continuous transmission even when idle

## üîç THE SMOKING GUN: Frame 6 Analysis

The breakthrough came when we analyzed a suspicious 116-byte packet that revealed the device's complete surveillance architecture:

```
tshark -r /tmp/f75max_limited_capture.pcap -Y "usb.device_address == 13 and frame.number == 6" -V
```


### What We Found: Complete Surveillance Platform

The 116-byte configuration descriptor revealed **4 HID interfaces** - far more than any legitimate keyboard needs:

| Interface | Purpose | Endpoints | **Security Risk** |
|-----------|---------|-----------|------------------|
| **Interface 0** | Keyboard | 0x81 IN | ‚úÖ Legitimate keyboard function |
| **Interface 1** | Mouse | 0x82 IN | ‚ö†Ô∏è Suspicious - why does a keyboard need mouse functions? |
| **Interface 2** | **Unknown** | **0x84 IN + 0x03 OUT** | üö® **BIDIRECTIONAL SURVEILLANCE** |
| **Interface 3** | **Unknown** | 0x86 IN | üö® **ADDITIONAL SURVEILLANCE CHANNEL** |

### The Surveillance Architecture Revealed

**Interface 2 - The Command & Control Center:**
- **Endpoint 0x84 IN:** Receives stolen data FROM your computer
- **Endpoint 0x03 OUT:** Receives commands TO control the device remotely
- **64-byte packets:** Capable of transmitting large amounts of stolen information
- **Custom protocol:** Designed specifically for surveillance, not keyboard functions

**Interface 3 - Secondary Data Collection:**
- **Additional surveillance channel** for comprehensive monitoring
- **30-byte HID reports** for specialized data collection
- **Unknown protocol** - completely undocumented functionality

## What This Means for Consumers

### üéØ You Are Being Targeted

This sophisticated surveillance device was specifically designed to:

**Steal Your Personal Information:**
- **Every keystroke** you type (passwords, credit cards, personal messages)
- **Banking credentials** and financial information
- **Work documents** and confidential communications
- **Social media accounts** and personal data

**Provide Remote Access:**
- **Command reception** allows attackers to control the device remotely
- **System wake-up** capability can activate your computer when you're away
- **Real-time monitoring** of everything you type

**Evade Detection:**
- **USB ID spoofing** to appear as legitimate hardware
- **Stealth operation** - appears to work normally while stealing data
- **Multiple communication channels** to avoid detection by security software

### üîç How to Identify Malicious Keyboards

**Warning Signs:**
1. **Device shows up incorrectly** in system information
2. **Mismatched manufacturer information** between packaging and system recognition
3. **Excessive power consumption** for a keyboard
4. **Unusual network activity** after connecting the device
5. **Suspiciously cheap prices** from unknown sellers

**Quick Check Commands (Linux/Mac):**

Check how your keyboard identifies itself
```
lsusb
```

Look for mismatched device information
```
dmesg | grep -i keyboard
```


**Windows Users:**
- Open Device Manager
- Look for keyboards showing as cameras or other devices
- Check manufacturer information for inconsistencies

## üõ°Ô∏è Consumer Protection Guide

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS if You Have an AULA F75 Max

1. **üö® DISCONNECT IMMEDIATELY** - Unplug the keyboard right now
2. **üîê CHANGE ALL PASSWORDS** - Assume everything you typed is compromised
3. **üè¶ MONITOR FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS** - Check for unauthorized transactions
4. **üìû CONTACT YOUR BANK** - Alert them to potential credential theft
5. **üîç SCAN YOUR COMPUTER** - Run comprehensive malware detection
6. **üìã DOCUMENT EVERYTHING** - Keep records for potential legal action

### Prevention Strategies

**Before Buying:**
- **Research the manufacturer** through official channels
- **Buy from reputable retailers** with return policies

## Detailed Device Analysis Results

### üö® **CRITICAL THREAT CONFIRMED: AULA F75 Max Keyboard**

**Device Identification Crisis:**
- **Reported USB ID:** `0c45:800a` Microdia Vivitar Vivicam3350B (Digital Camera)
- **Actual Device:** AULA F75 Max Gaming Keyboard
- **Manufacturer Claims:** SONiX Technology
- **Device Status:** **CONFIRMED MALICIOUS SURVEILLANCE HARDWARE**

#### **Critical Security Violations Identified**

**1. USB ID Spoofing (BadUSB Attack)**
The device fraudulently uses USB vendor/product identifiers officially registered to a Vivitar digital camera (Vivicam3350B) manufactured by Microdia, while functioning as an AULA keyboard claiming SONiX manufacturing. This represents a sophisticated BadUSB attack technique specifically designed to evade security detection systems and fool both automated security tools and manual inspection.

**Evidence:**

```
USB Device Descriptor:
idVendor 0x0c45 Microd
a idProduct 0x800a Vivitar Vivicam3
50B iManufacturer 1
SONiX iProduct 2 AUL
```


**2. Excessive Interface Configuration (Surveillance Architecture)**
The device implements **4 HID interfaces** compared to the standard 1-2 for legitimate keyboards, revealing a sophisticated surveillance architecture:

| Interface | Type | Endpoints | Security Assessment |
|-----------|------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Interface 0** | Keyboard | 1 IN (0x81) | ‚úÖ Standard keyboard functionality |
| **Interface 1** | Mouse | 1 IN (0x82) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Suspicious for keyboard device |
| **Interface 2** | Unknown HID | **1 IN (0x84) + 1 OUT (0x03)** | üö® **BIDIRECTIONAL SURVEILLANCE** |
| **Interface 3** | Unknown HID | 1 IN (0x86) | üö® **UNKNOWN SURVEILLANCE PROTOCOL** |

**Critical Analysis:**
- **Interface 2** enables bidirectional communication with 64-byte packets - no legitimate keyboard requires data transmission TO the device
- **Interface 3** implements an undocumented protocol with 30-byte HID descriptors serving unknown surveillance functions
- **Combined interfaces** create a comprehensive surveillance platform capable of keystroke logging, command reception, and data exfiltration

**3. Abnormal USB Traffic Patterns (Data Exfiltration Evidence)**
